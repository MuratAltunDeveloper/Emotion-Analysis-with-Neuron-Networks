This work is a sentiment analysis project that aims to classify the sentiment of texts (positive, negative, neutral or irrelevant) by analyzing user comments collected from social media platforms (specifically Twitter). The comments are subjected to an extensive natural language processing (NLP) preprocessing process before being used as input to an AI-based classification model. The resulting preprocessed data is processed with artificial neural network models to enable brands to analyze customer feedback more effectively and support strategic decision-making. Accordingly, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures are used in the classification task. In addition, the methods proposed in “Improving the Performance of Sentiment Analysis Using Enhanced Preprocessing Technique and Artificial Neural Network” were tested in this study.
